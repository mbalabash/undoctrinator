# Undoctrinator – Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 24 May 2025_

## 1. Developer

The code and the extension are free and open‑source under the MIT License.

---

## 2. Data I (do and don’t) collect

### 2.1 Stored locally

- **User settings** – feature preferences remain in your browser’s local storage. They leave your device only if you choose to sync Chrome.

### 2.2 Sent to my servers

No user data is sent to any servers I control.

### 2.3 Never collected

- Browsing history
- Personal profile data (name, email, etc.)
- Location, device identifiers, advertising IDs

---

## 3. How the data is used

1. The text content of the page or user-provided images are used for analysis to identify ideological markers, promoted values, emotional manipulations and logical fallacies.

**I do not** use or transfer user data for any other purpose—especially not for:

- Advertising or marketing
- Profiling or analytics beyond anonymous crash/usage counts
- Determining creditworthiness, lending, or insurance decisions

---

## 4. Data sharing & transfers

I **never sell, rent, or transfer** your data to third parties. The only third-party processors are cloud model API providers (currently OpenAI and Anthropic), who process API requests under a strict Data Processing Agreement.

---

## 5. Data retention

- Local settings stay on your device until you uninstall the extension or clear browser data.

---

## 6. Security

All communication uses HTTPS (TLS 1.3).

---

## 7. Children’s privacy

Undoctrinator is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect any personal data from them.

---

## 8. Changes to this policy

If something material changes I will:

1. Update this document,
2. Bump the "Last updated" date, and

I will **never** add new categories of data collection or broaden how your data is used without asking for explicit consent.

---

## 9. Contact

Questions? Email **[maksim.balabash@gmail.com](mailto:maksim.balabash@gmail.com)** and I’ll respond within **30 days**.

---

**TL;DR**
I collect almost nothing, use what little I do collect only to keep Undoctrinator working, and never share or sell your data. That’s the whole story.
